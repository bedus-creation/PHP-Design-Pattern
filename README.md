# PHP-Design-Pattern
* Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
* It's like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
* The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
* It's not a finish solution
* A template or recipe for solving problems 

# Classification of patterns
* **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
* **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
* **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
